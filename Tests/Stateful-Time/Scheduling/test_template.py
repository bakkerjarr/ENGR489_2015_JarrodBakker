# Test: InsertDescription of the test's purpose here with other details.
#       This template contains a variety of functions to perform
#       certain tasks, such as: send an ICMP echo request to a
#       particular host or send a TCP header with the SYN flag set to
#       a particular host on a given port.
#
# Usage: python test_name.py
#
# Test success: Scheduled rules appear in the correct order.
# Test failure: Scheduled rules are not in the correct order.
#
# Note:
#   - Test output can be found in test_name_results.log
#
#   - The script assumes that the syntax for the REST commands are
#     legal.
